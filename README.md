# Coding Sample

Sample 1 and 2 are examples of my Homework for my Bayesian statistics class. It all builds from statistical theory. I have included the code in R, the pdf of the output and the questions in separate files.

Sample 3 is a creative project. If you have a chance to run it on your terminal, it would be interesting to play. It is a video poker game, it includes a readme.txt file with the instructions on how to run it. It is written entirely in Java.

Sample 4 is a Python code to scrape all forms of a certain type from the SEC website for a research project.
